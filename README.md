# DirectXShowCase
This is a simple application (or game) that uses DirectX11 rendering and Dear ImGUI. This application demonstrates how to use a custom ImGUI window to modify rendered objects (similar to what you'd do in a video game widonw).
# NOTE:
This description will change when the game goes into actual development and design, this is just a temporary description at this stage in development.
